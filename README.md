## **Overview**

This is an easy-to-deploy [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) starter template created by [Ethan G.](https://egxo.dev). It is designed to streamline development with modern tools, ensuring a fast and efficient workflow from setup to deployment.

## **Technologies**

This template leverages a modern tech stack for a smooth developer experience:

- **Programming Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ‚Äì Ensures type safety and better maintainability.
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ‚Äì The leading React framework for hybrid static & server-side rendering.
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com) ‚Äì Optimized for seamless, serverless deployment.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) ‚Äì Utility-first CSS for rapid styling.
- **Linting & Formatting**:
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) ‚Äì Enforces code quality and best practices.
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) ‚Äì Automatic code formatting for consistency.
- **UI Components**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) ‚Äì A flexible, customizable UI component library.
- **Animations**: [Motion](https://motion.dev) ‚Äì Powerful animations with an intuitive API.
- **Icons**: [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/) ‚Äì Crisp, open-source React icons.
- **More**: TBD (Feel free to extend and customize based on your needs).

## **Before You Begin**

This template uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as the default package manager for faster dependency resolution and disk space efficiency. However, you can switch to `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun` if preferred.

### Updataing Package Manager

By default, this template enforces `pnpm`. To use another package manager, follow these steps:

#### 1. Remove `pnpm` Enforcement

Open `package.json` and modify or remove the following lines:

```json
"preinstall": "npx only-allow pnpm",
"prebuild": "pnpm run lint"
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies Using Your Preferred Manager

Run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install  # or yarn install, bun install
```

Now you're ready to start building! üöÄ

## **Getting Started**

#### 1. Clone the Template

First, clone the repository onto your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egarrisxn/xostarter.git my-next-starter-project
cd my-next-starter-project
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 3. Start the Development Server

Launch the local development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

#### 4. Open in Your Browser

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. TThe page will auto-update as you edit the file. Now, get to building! üöÄ

## **Configuration**

Easily customize your project by updating `utils/config.ts`. This file centralizes important settings, allowing for quick adjustments without modifying multiple files.

## **Styling**

This project utilizes [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) alongside [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4).

Since Tailwind v4 is still new (as of 2/27), we are using the canary version of the `shadcn/ui` CLI to add components. To install a UI component, run the following command, replacing `[component]` with the actual component name:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@canary add [component]
```

### Updating UI

To customize the base UI colors, you'll need to reconfigure your CSS variables. Run:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@canary init
```

## **Fonts**

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for optimized font loading. By default, it includes [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a modern typeface by Vercel.

You can easily swap out the font for another one. I recommend using `next/font` for built-in optimization or self-hosting fonts for better performance. Be mindful of font file sizes if sourcing them locally.

## **Metadata**

Since we are using the app router in **Next.js 15**, many metadata-related assets no longer need to be manually defined in the `<Head>` of your layout. Instead, Next.js automatically picks them up when they are placed in the `app` folder.

For example, the following files are already recognized by Next.js:

- **OpenGraph & Twitter images**: `opengraph-image.png` & `twitter-image.png` + alt. txt files.
- **Icons**: `favicon.ico`, `apple-icon.png`, `icon.svg`, & `icon.png`.
- **Manifest**: `manifest.ts`, `manifest.json`, `manifest.webmanifest`, OR `site.webmanifest`.
- **SEO & Crawler files**: `robots.ts` OR `robots.txt` & `sitemap.ts` OR `sitemap.xml`.

Because of this, metadata properties like `robots`, `icons`, `manifest`, and OpenGraph/Twitter images are **commented out** in `layout.tsx`. They are left in the code for reference, but they are not necessary unless you want to override the default behavior.

If you need to customize metadata on a **per-page basis**, you can still define it manually inside a `metadata` object in the corresponding page or layout file. Otherwise, Next.js will handle it automatically.

### Quick Note

For generating favicons, icons, and a `manifest.json`, I **highly** recommend visiting [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) and using their open-sourced tools.

## **Analytics**

This template includes [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics) for basic site tracking. After deployment, you can enable analytics through your Vercel dashboard.

If you prefer another analytics solution or are deploying elsewhere, simply uninstall the package and remove the import from `layout.tsx`.

## **Deployment**

For a seamless deployment experience, use the **Deploy** button below to launch your project on Vercel.

Note: You are not limited to Vercel and may deploy this template on any platform that supports Next.js. However, in my experience, Vercel provides the fastest and most convenient setup.
